### **Microprocessor Concepts Covered**
- **Peripheral Configuration:** Configure GPIO pins and timers for basic input/output functionality.  
- **Timers and Interrupts:** Use a timer to generate periodic interrupts for tasks like toggling LEDs.  
- **Hardware Abstraction Layers (HAL):** Utilize HAL libraries to interact with hardware components without directly accessing registers.  
- **Code Skeletons and Frameworks:** Understand the structure of auto-generated code in STM32CubeIDE and how to safely modify it.  
- **Clock Configuration:** Set up system and peripheral clocks for optimal operation of the microcontroller.
