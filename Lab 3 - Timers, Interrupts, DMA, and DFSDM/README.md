### **Learning Objectives**
- **Timers and Interrupts:** Understand and use timers and interrupts to achieve precise timing and control in embedded systems.  
- **Direct Memory Access (DMA):** Learn to offload data transfer tasks to DMA for efficient peripheral operation without CPU intervention.  
- **Digital Signal Processing (DSP):** Utilize the DFSDM (Digital Filter for Sigma-Delta Modulator) to process microphone input and rescale output for the DAC.  
- **Application Integration:** Develop a cohesive application combining multiple peripherals, including timers, DAC, and DFSDM.

### **Summary of the Problem and Deliverables**
#### **Problem:** Build a real-time audio processing and playback system that uses push-button inputs to control recording and playback of audio signals from a microphone, alongside generated tones.

### **Steps and Deliverables**
1. **Push-Button Interrupts (GPIO):**  
   - Implement an interrupt handler to toggle an LED when the button is pressed.  

2. **Timer-Driven DAC Output:**  
   - Configure a timer to periodically send sine wave data to the DAC for playback on a speaker.  
   - Ensure precise frequency generation by calculating timer intervals based on system clock rates.  

3. **Timer and DMA for DAC:**  
   - Replace the timer-based DAC handling with DMA to automate data transfer from a sine wave array to the DAC, reducing CPU usage.  

4. **DFSDM Microphone Input:**  
   - Configure the DFSDM to read data from the onboard microphone.  
   - Process and rescale the microphone data for real-time output via the DAC.  

5. **Integrated Application:**  
   - Create a program that records audio on button press, plays back both recorded audio and generated tones, and re-records on subsequent button presses.  
   - Use the LED to indicate the current state (e.g., recording, playback).  

6. **Final Demo:**  
   - Combine all functionalities into a single application that demonstrates:  
     - Audio recording and playback.  
     - Tone generation and state-based functionality.
