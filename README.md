---

### Lab 0: **Basic GPIO and LED Control**  
Introduced fundamental microcontroller programming concepts by configuring GPIO pins to control LEDs and process push-button inputs. Focused on using timers for precise timing and understanding hardware abstraction layers (HAL) for peripheral interaction.  

---

### Lab 1: **Performance Profiling and Assembly Optimization**  
Explored performance profiling techniques using ITM and implemented mathematical algorithms like maximum search and square root in both C and ARM assembly. Compared the efficiency of manual assembly optimization, high-level C code, and CMSIS-DSP library functions.  

---

### Lab 2: **Signal Processing with DAC and ADC**  
Covered DAC for generating waveforms (sine, triangle, and saw), ADC for sensor data acquisition, and GPIO for button-controlled signal manipulation. Emphasized signal scaling, waveform generation, and debugging using ITM and oscilloscopes.  

---

### Lab 3: **Timers, Interrupts, DMA, and DFSDM**  
Explored the use of timers and interrupts for periodic DAC updates, and DMA for efficient data transfer without CPU intervention. Integrated DFSDM for microphone input, creating a system for real-time audio recording and playback.  

---

### Lab 4: **I2C, UART, RTOS, and QSPI Flash**  
Focused on multitasking with FreeRTOS to handle sensor data acquisition via I2C, data transmission over UART, and storage in QSPI flash memory. Explored real-time task scheduling, data analysis, and performance improvements using an embedded operating system.  

---

### Final Project: **Feature Integration and Optimization**  
Integrated multiple peripherals like I2C sensors, UART, DAC, and QSPI flash to build an interactive application with real-time audio feedback and data logging. Emphasized performance optimization techniques, such as threading with RTOS and manual assembly enhancements, to improve system efficiency.
